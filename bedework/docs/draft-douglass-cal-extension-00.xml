      <t>
        This specification introduces a number of new iCalendar properties
        which are of particular use for event publishers and in social
        networking.
      </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The currently existing iCalendar standard <xref target='RFC5545'/> lacks
        useful methods for referencing additional, external information
        relating to calendar components.
      </t>

      <t>
        This document defines a number of properties referencing external
        information that can provide additional information about an iCalendar
        component. The intent is that such information can be automatically
        discovered and used by clients. Formats such as VCARD are likely to be
        most useful. 
      </t>

      <section anchor="conventions" title='Conventions Used in This Document'>
        <t>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
          NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
          "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
          described in <xref target='RFC2119'/>.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Typed References">
      <t>
        The properties defined here can all reference external meta-data which  
        may be used by applications to
        provide enhanced value to users. By providing type information  
        as parameters, clients and servers are able to discover interesting 
        references and make use of them, perhaps for indexing or the 
        presentation of additional related information for the user. 
      </t>

      <t>
        These properties are designed to handle common use cases in event 
        publication. It is generally important to provide information about the 
        organizers of such events. Sponsors wish to be referenced in a 
        prominent manner. In social calendaring it is often important to 
        identify the active participants in the event, for example a school 
        sports team, and the inactive participants, for example the parents.
      </t>

      <t>
        The <xref target='RFC5545'/> LOCATION property provides only
        an unstructured single text value for specifying the location where an event
        (or "TODO" item) will occur. This is inadequate for use cases where
        structured location information (e.g. address, region, country, 
        postal code) is required or preferred, and limits widespread adoption of
        iCalendar in those settings. 
      </t>

      <t>
        In addition, using STRUCTURED-LOCATION, information about a number of interesting 
        locations can be communicated, for example, parking, restaurants and
        the venue. Servers and clients can retrieve the objects when
        storing the event and use them to index by geographic location.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        The properties defined here are all URI references to some related data. 
        When a calendar client receives a calendar component it can search the 
        set of supplied properties looking for those of particular interest.
        The TYPE and FMTTYPE parameters, if supplied, can be used to help the 
        selection.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Having located such a property, e.g. STRUCTURED-LOCATION with TYPE=PARKING, 
        the client can use http GET on the supplied URL perhaps with an ACCEPT header set
        to specify the desired format. The targeted server SHOULD respond with
        a 406 if the resource is not available in the desired format(s).
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Use Cases">
      <t>
        The main motivation for these properties has been event publication but 
        there are opportunities for use elsewhere. The following use cases will
        describe some possible scenarios.
      </t>
      
      <section title="Piano Concert Performance">
        <t>
          In putting together a concert there are many participants: piano tuner,
          performer, stage hands etc. In addition there are sponsors and various 
          contacts to be provided. There will also be a number of related locations.
          A number of events can be created, all of
          which relate to the performance in different ways. 
        </t>
        
        <t>
          There may be an iTip meeting request for the piano tuner who will arrive 
          before the performance. Other members of staff may also receive meeting
          requests.
        </t>
        
        <t>
          An event can also be created for publication which will have a PARTICIPANT
          reference to the pianist providing vcard information about the performer.
          This event would also hold information about parking, local subway stations
          and the venue itself. In addition, there will be sponsorship information 
          for sponsors of the event and perhaps paid sponsorship properties
          essentially advertising local establishments.
        </t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Itineraries">
        <t>
          These properties also provide opportunities for the travel industry.
          When booking a flight the SPONSOR property can be used to provide 
          references to businesses at the airports and to car hire businesses
          at the destination.
        </t>
        
        <t>
          The embedded location information can guide the traveller at the airport
          or to their final destination. The contact information can provide
          detailed information about the booking agent, the airlines and car hire 
          companies and the hotel.
