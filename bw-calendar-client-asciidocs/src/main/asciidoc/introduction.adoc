The calendar client code for bedework.

This documentation is mostly a place-holder.

The code currently provides 2 main functions: clients which interact with the engine and web clients which use those clients and provide a web based service for users and departmental sites.

Work is underway to create a low-level client and a high-level client which will provide better support for different kinds of web and command-line client.
