Internet-Draft  Event Publishing Extensions to Icalendar  September 2012


1.  Introduction

   The currently existing iCalendar standard [RFC5545] lacks useful
   methods for referencing additional, external information relating to
   calendar components.

   This document defines a number of properties referencing external
   information that can provide additional information about an
   iCalendar component.  The intent is that such information can be
   automatically discovered and used by clients.  Formats such as VCARD
   are likely to be most useful.

   In addition a new property is defined to support HTML descriptions.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


2.  Typed References

   The properties defined here can all reference external meta-data
   which may be used by applications to provide enhanced value to users.
   By providing type information as parameters, clients and servers are
   able to discover interesting references and make use of them, perhaps
   for indexing or the presentation of additional related information
   for the user.

   These properties are designed to handle common use cases in event
   publication.  It is generally important to provide information about
   the organizers of such events.  Sponsors wish to be referenced in a
   prominent manner.  In social calendaring it is often important to
   identify the active participants in the event, for example a school
   sports team, and the inactive participants, for example the parents.

   The [RFC5545] LOCATION property provides only an unstructured single
   text value for specifying the location where an event (or "TODO"
   item) will occur.  This is inadequate for use cases where structured
   location information (e.g. address, region, country, postal code) is
   required or preferred, and limits widespread adoption of iCalendar in
   those settings.

   Using STRUCTURED-LOCATION, information about a number of interesting
   locations can be communicated, for example, parking, restaurants and
   the venue.  Servers and clients can retrieve the objects when storing

Internet-Draft  Event Publishing Extensions to Icalendar  September 2012


   the event and use them to index by geographic location.

   When a calendar client receives a calendar component it can search
   the set of supplied properties looking for those of particular
   interest.  The TYPE and FMTTYPE parameters, if supplied, can be used
   to help the selection.

   Having located such a property, e.g.  STRUCTURED-LOCATION with
   TYPE=PARKING, the client can use http GET on the supplied URL perhaps
   with an ACCEPT header set to specify the desired format.  The
   targeted server SHOULD respond with a 406 if the resource is not
   available in the desired format(s).


3.  Use Cases

   The main motivation for these properties has been event publication
   but there are opportunities for use elsewhere.  The following use
   cases will describe some possible scenarios.

3.1.  Piano Concert Performance

   In putting together a concert there are many participants: piano
   tuner, performer, stage hands etc.  In addition there are sponsors
   and various contacts to be provided.  There will also be a number of
   related locations.  A number of events can be created, all of which
   relate to the performance in different ways.

   There may be an iTip meeting request for the piano tuner who will
   arrive before the performance.  Other members of staff may also
   receive meeting requests.

   An event can also be created for publication which will have a
   PARTICIPANT reference to the pianist providing vcard information
   about the performer.  This event would also hold information about
   parking, local subway stations and the venue itself.  In addition,
   there will be sponsorship information for sponsors of the event and
   perhaps paid sponsorship properties essentially advertising local
   establishments.

3.2.  Itineraries

   These properties also provide opportunities for the travel industry.
   When booking a flight the SPONSOR property can be used to provide
   references to businesses at the airports and to car hire businesses
   at the destination.

   The embedded location information can guide the traveller at the

   airport or to their final destination.  The contact information can
   provide detailed information about the booking agent, the airlines
   and car hire companies and the hotel.


4.  New Property Parameters

4.1.  Hash

   Parameter name:  HASH

   Purpose:  To specify a hash of the value of another property.

   Format Definition:

      This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     hashparam      = "HASH" "=" DQUOTE text "/" text DQUOTE

   Description:  This parameter can be specified on properties that are
      variants of another property and is used to detect changes in that
      property to enable the values of all variants to be kept
      synchronized.  Each property that uses the "HASH" parameter MUST
      define which other property the "HASH" is calculated from.

      The text value should be the hash value (encoded as a hexadecimal
      string) followed by a single "/", followed by a token describing
      the algorithm used to calculate the hash value.  Algorithm names
      from the IANA Hash Function Textual Names registry [] MUST be
      used.

   Example:

          STYLED-DESCRIPTION;HASH="699EAEE6CDB049F8B
           E9E3329AAC2415A/SHA-1":Some Text

4.2.  Idh

   Parameter name:  ID

   Purpose:  To uniquely identify a property.

   Format Definition:

      This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     idparam      = "ID" "=" param-value




Douglass                 Expires March 31, 2013                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  Event Publishing Extensions to Icalendar  September 2012


   Description:  This parameter can be specified on any property.  It is
      used to uniquely identify the property so it can be related to
      other properties that specify an "IDREF" parameter whose value
      matches the "ID" value.  Properties within the same component MUST
      NOT have an "ID" parameter with the same value.

   Example:

          DESCRIPTION;ID=2:Some Text
          STYLED-DESCRIPTION;ID=3;IDREF=2:Other Text

4.3.  Idref

   Parameter name:  IDREF

   Purpose:  To relate one property to another.

   Format Definition:

      This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     idrefparam      = "IDREF" "=" param-value ; ??? multi-valued

   Description:  This parameter can be specified on any property.  It is
      used to uniquely relate one property to another.  The value of the
      "IDREF" parameter is set to the value of the "ID" parameter on the
      property to which it is being related.

   Example:

          DESCRIPTION;ID=2:Some Text
          STYLED-DESCRIPTION;IDREF=2:Other Text

4.4.  Loctype

   Parameter name:  TYPE

   Purpose:  To specify the type of location.

   Format Definition:

      This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     loctypeparam   = "LOCTYPE" "=" text







Douglass                 Expires March 31, 2013                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft  Event Publishing Extensions to Icalendar  September 2012


   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on STRUCTURED-LOCATION
      and provides a way to differentiate multiple properties.  For
      example, it allows event producers to provide location information
      for the venue and the parking.

      Values for this parameter are taken from the values defined in
      [RFC5545].  New location types SHOULD be registered in the manner
      laid down in that specification

4.5.  Parttype

   Parameter name:  PARTTYPE

   Purpose:  To specify the type of participant.

   Format Definition:

      This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     parttypeparam   = "PARTTYPE" "=" text

   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on the PARTICIPANT
      property, and defines the type of participation.  Allowable values
      are defined in Section 6.

4.6.  Order

   Parameter name:  ORDER

   Purpose:  To define ordering for the associated property.

   Format Definition:

      This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     orderparam    = "ORDER" "=" (1*2DIGIT / "10")
                                   ; An integer between 1 and 100.

   Description:  The ORDER parameter is OPTIONAL and is used to indicate
      the relative ordering of the corresponding instance of a property.
      Its value MUST be an integer between 1 and 100 that quantifies the
      order.  Lower values correspond to a higher level of ordering,
      with 1 being the highest.

      When the parameter is absent, the default MUST be to interpret the
      property instance as being at the lowest level of ordering.

Internet-Draft  Event Publishing Extensions to Icalendar  September 2012


      Note that the value of this parameter is to be interpreted only in
      relation to values assigned to other correcsponding instances of
      the same property in the same entity.  A given value, or the
      absence of a value, MUST NOT be interpreted on its own.

      This parameter MAY be applied to any property that allows multiple
      instances.

4.7.  Title

   Parameter name:  TITLE

   Purpose:  To provide a human readable title.

   Format Definition:

      This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     titleparam     = "TITLE" "=" text

   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on all properties
      defined in this specification, and provides a human readable
      label, perhaps for icons or links..


5.  New Properties

5.1.  Participant

   Property name:  PARTICIPANT

   Purpose:  This property provides a typed reference to external
      information about participants in an event or optionally a plain
      text typed value.

   Value type:  The default value type for this property is URI.  The
      value type can also be set to TEXT to indicate plain text content.

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard, title, type or format type
      parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MAY be specified in any iCalendar
      component.

   Description:  When used in a component the value of this property
      points to information about an event participant.  This is NOT an
      attendee in a scheduling sense and the ATTENDEE property may in
      fact be specified in addition.  Participants in events can be

      individuals or organizations, for example a soccer team, the
      spectators, or the musicians.

   Format Definition:

      This property is defined by the following notation:

     participant     = "PARTICIPANT" partparam (":" uri)  /
                       (
                         ";" "VALUE" "=" "TEXT"
                         ":" text
                       )
                       CRLF

     partparam      = *(

                     ; the following are OPTIONAL
                     ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                     (";" fmttypeparam) /
                     (";" titleparam) /
                     (";" orderparam) /
                     (";" parttypeparam) /

                     ; the following is OPTIONAL
                     ; and MAY occur more than once

                     (";" other-param)

                     )


   Note:  When the ORDER parameter is supplied it defines the ordering
      of PARTICIPANT properties with the same value for the TYPE
      parameter.

   Example:

      The following is an example of this property.  It points to a
      VCARD providing information on an event participant.

                    PARTICIPANT;TYPE=PRINCIPAL_PERFORMER:
                      http://dir.example.com/vcard/aviolinist.vcf

   Example:

      The following is an example referring to a VCARD providing
      information on the primary contact.

                    PARTICIPANT;FMTTYPE=text/vcard;TYPE=PRIMARY-CONTACT;
                      TITLE=A contact:
                      http://dir.example.com/vcard/contacts/contact1.vcf

   Example:

      The following is an example of the property used to link to VCARD
      information on the event planner.

                    STRUCTURED-CONTACT;FMTTYPE=text/vcard;
                      TYPE=PLANNER-CONTACT;TITLE=ClownsIsUs:
                      http://dir.example.com/vcard/clowns-is-us.vcf

5.2.  Styled-Description

   Property name:  STYLED-DESCRIPTION

   Purpose:  This property provides a more complete description of the
      calendar component than that provided by the "SUMMARY" property.

   Value type:  The default value type for this property is TEXT.  The
      value type can also be set to URI.  Other text-based value types
      can be used when defined in the future.  Clients MUST ignore any
      properties with value types they do not understand.

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, alternate text
      representation, and language property parameters can be specified
      on this property.

   Conformance:  The property can be specified multiple times in the
      "VEVENT", "VTODO", "VJOURNAL", or "VALARM" calendar components.

   Description:  This property is used in the "VEVENT" and "VTODO" to
      capture lengthy textual descriptions associated with the activity.
      This property is used in the "VJOURNAL" calendar component to
      capture one or more textual journal entries.  This property is
      used in the "VALARM" calendar component to capture the display
      text for a DISPLAY category of alarm, and to capture the body text
      for an EMAIL category of alarm.

Internet-Draft  Event Publishing Extensions to Icalendar  September 2012


      VALUE=TEXT is used to provide html variants of the plain-text
      DESCRIPTION property.

      VALUE=URI is used to provide a link to html content which is
      expected to be displayed inline as part of the event.

      The "HASH" parameter value is calculated from the value of any
      "DESCRIPTION" property present in the same component.  If no
      "DESCRIPTION" is present, then the "HASH" parameter MUST NOT be
      present.

      The intent of this property is limited to providing a styled
      version of the DESCRIPTION property.  The URL property should be
      used to link to websites or other related information.

   Format Definition:

      This property is defined by the following notation:

     styleddescription = "STYLED-DESCRIPTION" styleddescparam ":"
                                         text CRLF

     styleddescparam   = *(

                  ; The value of this parameter MUST match the type of
                  ; data supplied in the value of the property


   Example:

      The following is an example of this property.  It points to a
      venue.

                    STRUCTURED-LOCATION;TITLE="The venue":

5.3.  Structured-Location

   Property name:  STRUCTURED-LOCATION

   Purpose:  This property provides a typed reference to external
      information about the location of an event or optionally a plain
      text typed value.

   Value type:  The default value type for this property is URI.  The
      value type can also be set to TEXT to indicate plain text content.

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard, title, type or format type
      parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MAY be specified zero or more times in
      any iCalendar component.

   Description:  When used in a component the value of this property
      provides information about the event venue or of related services
      such as parking, dining, stations etc..

   Format Definition:

      This property is defined by the following notation:

     extloc         = "STRUCTURED-LOCATION" extlocparam (":" uri)  /
                       (
                         ";" "VALUE" "=" "TEXT"
